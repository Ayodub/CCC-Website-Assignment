### 1.Project goals, target audience and tech stack:

The purpose of the following project was to build a portfolio website to showcase my abilities and experience to prospective employers. This portfolio website is able to communicate these skills in two ways:

- First, the webpage contains content such as my CV, list of completed projects, and a blog section, each of which is able to showcase these skills.
- Additionally, the website is coded from the ground up using pure HTML and CSS, as opposed to using a CMS such as Wordpress. Therefore, the website itself is also evidence of coding ability which may be visually assessed by the prospective employer.



Ultimately, the goal of this project can be stated as the following:

 ***Goal:*** ***To comprehensively convey personal skill set and achievements to the prospective employer in the most efficient and clear way possible***.





### 2.Website design, and how it achieves these goals:

Key points of the above goal description are ***efficient and clear***. These were successfully achieved through the emphasis placed upon several specific features. In particular:

- Minimal descriptive text in each section, such as in the about me or above the portfolio/blog pages. It was considered that a summary, if provided, may be used by prospective employers as an alternative to viewing the portfolio or CV. Both the portfolio and CV provide a more comprehensive, **efficient**, and **clear** overview of my abilities and experience. 

- Clear and accessible call to action pointing toward portfolio and CV. This was achieved through providing multiple pathways from each page toward both of these resources. These pathways were in the format of either buttons placed clearly across the page, or through the navigation bar.

As seen by this site map, three of the four pages contain a link pointing toward the CV, and each also has access to the portfolio via the navigation bar, or an additional button. Implementation of this can be seen in the following screenshot:![home-image](C:\Users\Michelle Qiu\Desktop\TomCrossman_T1A2\docs/home-image.JPG)

also note the access tabs to Github and Linkedin. which similarly provide effective and efficient overviews of projects and professional experience.

A consistent theme, both visually and strategically, can be seen across the other pages of the website:

### 3.Responsiveness

Due to the increasing dominance of phones and tablets over desktops, it is important that all modern websites are able to be viewed easily on these devices. Especially important when considering responsiveness is that the mobile/tablet view of the webpages retains it's original objective. In the current case, that is, for the viewer to easily access all of the professional profiles, portfolio, and CV. Below are images demonstrating that the website effectively retains this quality on mobile devices:

### 4.Conclusion:

Ease of access to key material, and simple navigation, will allow prospective employers quick access to multiple professional summaries. These include a project portfolio, Github, CV, and LinkedIn. Additionally, the ground-up coding of the website in itself allows to demonstrate ability in HTML and CSS.
